# History Maker Golf

This app is for Windows and MacOS and is a compliment to History Maker Golf board game by Plaay Games. It is not a substitution and  cannot be used without the full game components of the board game.

## Installation

Download the zip file for the appropiate operation system. Open the zip file and install the .exe/.pkg file and follow prompts. It is recommended to install it to the default path to make it easier to update the app for future updates.

## Usage

> Golfers/Courses

The app uses .txt files to store golfer and course information. In order to import your own, you will need to export a course/golfer to get the format required and make your edits. You can then import the edited txt file to add content to your app.

You can add a golfer to any roster in app by the `Add Golfer` button inside the `View Golfers` screen. You can toggle courses inside the `View Courses` screen using the `Course Collection` button. This will allow you to use only courses that you own to make it easier while using the app.

> Custom Headshots/Logos

The app includes 800+ PGA Tour headshots and 60+ PGA Tour tournament logos. In order to use custom headshots/logos, you will need to navigate to `C:\Users\{USER NAME}\AppData\Roaming\history-maker-golf\custom`. You will see a headshots and logos folder, you will place the image in the appropriate folder.

Headshots must be named as following: `FIRST LAST.png` ex. `TIGER WOODS.png`. The image MUST be a .PNG. 

Logos must be named the same as your tournament name. `The Masters` would not match `The Masters at Augusta`, logos must be .PNG.

> Setting up a Tournament

You can set up a tournament in Play  Now or Season Mode. Season mode will fill in the information that is obtained during setup, play now requires full information to be entered (Tournament Name, Course, Scoring, Field Size).

Clicking a player will place a blue circle with a white checkmark to indicate that player is selected. Continue adding players to the field until the field matches the field size. You can click `SAVE` and it will save your current field and you can come back later to finish adding your participants. `CLEAR` will delete the current setup.

`USE FEDEX` in Play Now is meant to be used if you want a Fedex leaderboard to be generated at the end of the tournament. If you decide to use this tournament in a season mode later on, you will be able to export it and import into your season (as long as it is the same roster).

Contenders are to be selected the same way as the field was in previous step. Each contender must have a score entered before continuing. You can add a perk at this stage if needed, be careful, you cannot remove it until in game if you make a mistake. The scoring chart included is a community based chart and is optional, it is there for reference if you want to use it, the lighter blue tab indicates which column to use based on the scoring you selected.

For final groupings, place the players in the correct groups that you did outside the app. Any remaining players not placed in a group will automatically be added to your CUT group. It will not allow any player to not be in a group, this avoids any game breaking errors.

> Playing a Tournament

The tournament leaderboard shows ALL scores, even those finished. If you want to just see the contenders, click the PGA logo on the leaderboard to toggle it. You can scroll on the leaderboard if viewing all to see all the scores and finishes.

As you score in the board game, choose the correct hole score for the golfer that is currently up. Once both golfers in that pair have scored, you can click the right arrow to advance to next hole. If you need to make notes, you can click the sticky note icon to the right of the golfer's name to add custom notes. You can toggle perks on and off at any time, if you need a TFN perk, click the perk at the top of the scorecard after making it active. You will see (TFN) be added, this will be kept after tournament ceases in season mode and tracked.

You will be prompted for emerging contenders at the proper hole and can use or not use emerging contenders. 

Once the tournament is finished, you will be prompted a winner (if this shows incorrect, just make sure at the final leaderboard it is correct and you are ok, if it is still wrong, let me know, I am currently working on this visual fix).

> Setting up Season Mode

When setting up your season, if you use playoffs, it will add 3 events to the end of the season and follow the current PGA FedEx Cup system. If you turn this off, you are responsible for adding your ending events, the season will end after the last event and declare the winner. If using FedEx Cup Playoffs, the winner will be the winner of the PGA TOUR Championship. If not, it will be the leading FedEx Cup points leader.

When adding events, I have included a file if you are using real events to match the logos included. The tournament name MUST match what is on that txt file for your logo to appear correctly. If you want to use your own logos, just make sure Tournament name and your logo name match.

Currently, Network theme does not matter.

> Season Mode

There is a ton to discover in season mode. You can navigate using the menu at the top to view/edit Schedule, View Players and their profiles, and view full FedEx Cup Leaderboard.

When you click any golfer's name inside the app, you will be taken to their player profile with their season history! Clicking on an event name will take you to that leaderboard. Inside of schedule tab, you can view and edit the entire schedule. The file upload icon is used for the current tournament if you need to import results from a Play Now tournament. You can also add additional events if needed.

When you are ready to play your tournament for the week, click play tournament and follow the steps like Play Now, but notice some fields are already filled out. During the playoffs, the field is AUTOMATIC and will pull the top 125, top 70, top 30 just like real life, making setup much quicker.

At the end of the season and after all events are played, you will be shown a Season Recap home page to see the winner, the top contenders in certain categories, and can review the final FedEx Cup leaderboard.
